      <h2>Jeremy</h2>
      
      <p>I am Jeremy Power, I currently live in the Salt Lake Valley, which is in Utah.  
        I have been living here for the past 12 years with my wife, two boys, our cat, 
        and a nursery of about 40 guppies that my boys accidentally started to raise, 
        that is what happens when you buy 1 pregnant guppy. I am studying Public health 
        with an emphasis on Education.</p>
      
      <p>I have been working as a nurse for 17 years and 
        want to get out of the nursing field and move into the education and policy field 
        within the medical systems.  I am hoping that with my background and the education 
        that I will get from the Public Health major it will help me to progress my career 
        in education and prevention.</p>
